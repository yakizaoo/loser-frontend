# Video Tutorials App

This project is a web application designed to provide video tutorials and facilitate course sales for schoolchildren and students. The application is built using React for the client-side and Node.js for the server-side.

## Client-Side

The client-side of the application is structured as follows:

- **Main Menu**: A navigation menu that allows users to easily access different sections of the website.
- **Overview**: A brief description of the website's purpose, focusing on the educational content available for students.

### Getting Started

To get started with the client-side application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Folder Structure

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file where the React app is rendered.
- `src/components/`: Contains React components for the application.
- `src/styles/`: Contains CSS styles for the application.

### Design

The application features a minimalist design with a white background and black buttons, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Server-Side

The server-side of the application handles requests and serves the client-side application. It is built using Node.js and Express.

### Getting Started

To get started with the server-side application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```
